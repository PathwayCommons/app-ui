		"description": "Regulates food intake, energy expenditure and body weight in response to metabolic and toxin-induced stresses (PubMed:28953886, PubMed:28846097, PubMed:28846098, PubMed:28846099, PubMed:23468844, PubMed:29046435). Binds to its receptor, GFRAL, and activates GFRAL-expressing neurons localized in the area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarius of the brainstem (PubMed:28953886, PubMed:28846097, PubMed:28846098, PubMed:28846099). It then triggers the activation of neurons localized within the parabrachial nucleus and central amygdala, which contitutes part of the 'emergency circuit' that shapes feeding responses to stressful conditions (PubMed:28953886). On hepatocytes, inhibits growth hormone signaling",
